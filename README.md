# Workshop Code

This is all the code for todays workshop. It is split into branches for the two parts of the workshop. ~~The master branch is left empty intentionally.~~

### Edit
For the benefit of those who don't know how to use git, the `master` branch has the relevant code in each folder.

## Steps
1. Copy the contents of commands.sql into your MySQL client (or PHPMyAdmin), and run them
  * Do this if you are uncertain about your test data and want a fresh start
2. Copy the code into your document root `/var/www/html/workshop` or `C:\xampp\htdocs\wokshop`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost/workshop/` and it should run
  * Don't forget to change the username and password in the php files
  * If you haven't set a password, chances are, these are your default credentials
